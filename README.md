# Freshman - Image Quality Detection System

## Overview

**Freshman** is an advanced machine learning-based software designed to assess the quality of images. Using cutting-edge image processing techniques and deep learning models, it achieves a remarkable accuracy rate of **99%**, automating quality checks for a wide range of use cases. Whether for industrial quality control, e-commerce, or media, Freshman ensures precise and efficient image quality assessments.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 99% accuracy using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image quality detection.
- **Preprocessing**: Employs techniques such as normalization, noise filtering, and segmentation to enhance image quality before analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes textures, contours, edges, and brightness for comprehensive detection of defects and anomalies.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback and integrates seamlessly with existing systems to automate quality control workflows.
- **Scalable**: Can be deployed across various industries, improving operational efficiency by minimizing manual intervention.

## Installation

To set up Freshman locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freshman.git
   cd freshman
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Image Acquisition**: Freshman captures high-resolution images using camera systems. Proper lighting conditions are used to ensure clarity and avoid interference.
   
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are normalized, filtered, and segmented to remove noise and focus on key features, like edges and textures.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Using advanced algorithms, features such as contours, textures, and color patterns are extracted for analysis.

4. **Classification**: The trained CNN model classifies images based on extracted features, detecting defects, anomalies, and quality attributes.

5. **Output & Feedback**: Freshman outputs real-time quality feedback and integrates with external systems for automated handling.

## Usage

To detect the quality of an image, simply provide the image path in the command line:

```bash
python app.py --image <path_to_image>
```

The system will process the image and return a quality score, along with details on any detected defects.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN models)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Flask (for web interface, if needed)
- Docker (for deployment)
